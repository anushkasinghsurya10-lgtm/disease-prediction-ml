# Disease Prediction from Medical Data ðŸ©º

This project applies Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) 
to predict the possibility of diseases from structured medical datasets.

## Features
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Handles categorical & numerical features
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Visualization: ROC curves, Confusion matrix, Feature importance
- Model explainability with SHAP

## Datasets
- Breast Cancer (sklearn built-in)
- Diabetes, Heart Disease (UCI ML Repository)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
